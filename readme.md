#Angular2 QuickStart Boilerplate

This repo does just hold the files from the [Angular 5min quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) tutorial, plus a little helper (`install.js`).

## Install:

 - update `package.json` with your `name` , `version` and `license`
 - run `npm install`

(Alternatively run `node install`)

## Development

Develop in `app` folder.
The package comes with all the tooling you require for basic development. (Hats off to the Angular devs!)

`npm start` will run the typescript compiler in watchmode and spin up `lite-server`.
`index.html` will be loaded in your browser and refreshed on watchmode events.
